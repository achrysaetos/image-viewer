# Image Viewer

This is a simple image viewer that allows you to view images and draw bounding boxes on them. Built with React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn/UI.

* To implement zoom and pan, I used the [react-zoom-pan-pinch](https://github.com/BetterTyped/react-zoom-pan-pinch) package.
* To draw the bounding box, I implemented my own component in pages/playground.tsx
* Three main files: 
  * pages/index.tsx: the main page
  * pages/playground.tsx: the image viewer component
  * pages/configform.tsx: the settings selection component

That's mostly it! Thanks a lot.
